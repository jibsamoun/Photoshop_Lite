Java Photo Editing Project
This Java application is designed for photo editing, enabling users to alter the RGB values of pixels using various filters. The project utilizes image processing algorithms to implement seven different filter options: Laplacian, Gaussian Blur, Negative, Edgy, Unsharp Masking, Vertical Flip, and Horizontal Flip.

Features
Laplacian Filter: Enhances edges in the image.
Gaussian Blur: Smooths the image by applying a Gaussian blur.
Negative: Inverts the colors of the image.
Edgy Filter: Creates a sharp, high-contrast appearance.
Unsharp Masking: Sharpens the image edges.
Vertical Flip: Flips the image vertically.
Horizontal Flip: Flips the image horizontally.
